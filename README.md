[00:07.38] Don't know where we disconnected each of our stories
[00:11.45] Now we go once again past where we have split off
[00:15.21] Even if many times, we have been separated, you can see
[00:19.73] We're connected, still
[00:30.73] 
[00:28.11] So, goodbye, farewell then
[00:30.27] We said the words, departed
[00:31.59] How many morning suns have we seen ever since that day
[00:35.99] In our respective new future destinations
[00:39.59] Extension of that day
[00:41.32] Today is when we meet
[00:51.82] 
[00:43.03] With every moment that leads up to our meeting time
[00:46.48] I keep feeling my heart beating louder as the seconds pass
[00:50.75] As I look up at the sky that has cleared from the rain
[00:54.44] It was just like what we saw that day
[00:57.30] Upon us was a seven-colored bridge
[01:14.30] 
[01:00.09] Here and now, we were able to meet once again
[01:03.62] We have kept our connection alive all along
[01:07.38] The things we talk about
[01:08.55] We wanna speak about
[01:09.52] Are never ending, overflowing out, and so
[01:12.11] Hold up, this won't be loosening, for we know
[01:34.61] 
[01:14.93] We were rushed by the seasons, forever moving
[01:18.79] And beyond where the roads could be leading us to
[01:22.37] No matter where we stand
[01:23.65] As often as we want
[01:24.64] We gotta tie our strings together like before
[01:27.21] We'll meet again soon
[01:37.71] 
[01:29.35] What was this?
[01:30.80] And now, we cannot end the reminiscence
[01:32.78] And those recollections, retentions
[01:34.66] We trace and we laugh
[01:35.88] Filling in sceneries we were living apart
[01:37.44] The conversation offer a shortcut
[01:39.68] And we don't even need to worry about tomorrow
[01:41.32] As if in a machine, and we're back to our past
[02:04.32] 
[01:43.15] In any case
[01:44.16] Some changes that each of us have witnessed
[01:47.81] In total honesty, there's been too much of them
[01:51.45] But we know, 'til this day
[01:54.55] It's all of our surprise
[01:56.23] That everything is still the same
[02:12.73] 
[02:12.08] When we look up at the sky, notice it's turning white
[02:15.95] We're exhausted and we see upon one side of our cheeks
[02:19.70] A gentle touch and a stroke from the warmth of the sun
[02:23.42] It was just like what we saw that day
[02:26.54] We return to our individual days
[02:42.54] 
[02:29.68] Hey, every step that each of us have walked up to now
[02:33.75] Has been on separate pathways, we know
[02:36.63] But the same morning sun is above and shining bright on us
[02:41.23] We've got to, once again, overlap now
[02:59.73] 
[02:45.98] Don't know where we lost connection within our stories
[02:49.85] Once again, we return to what lies there beyond
[02:53.35] The things we talk about
[02:54.77] We wanna speak about
[02:55.52] The pages will soon be filling up, you'll see
[02:58.21] So, now, let's keep on adding to the story
[03:19.21] 
[03:01.11] Even the setting red sun we looked up at once
[03:04.74] And the blue days of youth we have spent together
[03:08.46] Our memories won't forget
[03:09.62] Never to fade away
[03:10.52] And like the way the greens will always sprout
[03:12.73] We can meet again some time
[03:15.11] Our stories always start
[03:16.97] With a white morning sunshine every time, and so
[03:20.72] "See ya tomorrow"
